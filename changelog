v1.1 - 2021-05-01
- Fixed an issue with the GPRS date/time comparison against the compile date/time. Apparently the Arduino compile date variable (__DATE__) adds an extra space whenever a date is a singel digit number (to keep the string length consistent, I assume). That breaks stuff if you don't compensate for it...
- Fixed "Deep Sleep" SMS command so that it's possible to set a custom wakeup time without issue.
- Added additional SMS-alerts to help with automating notification sounds on your phone (using Tasker or similar).
- Improved some SMS messages to be more informative.

v1.0 - 2021-04-27
- Initial release
